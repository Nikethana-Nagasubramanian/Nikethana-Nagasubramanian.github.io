<h1 style = "text-align: center;">THE FRIEND I MISSED</h1><br>
    <p style = "font-size: 15px; border: 1px solid rgb(103, 103, 103);">Everyone has this one friend right from kindergarten. Well, most people do. I did too. This girl was extremely innocent, charming and super-friendly. We grew up together and we went through similar incidents. Whether it was love, hate, anger or regret we felt it together but there was something peculiar about her. Our perspectives began growing different. As years passed by I started to feel a little out-of-focus. You know what they say about adolescence.I felt as if the world hit the spot light on her and I craved for attention. It was when I started to ridicule her in every way possible. I made fun of her appearance and teased her along with other people but somehow she managed to keep up this God-like smile on her face no matter what.


        It infuriated me. I began to let her get abused by people and laughed at her. She still trusted me as her close friend. And no matter what I did to drive her away, she stayed by my side! Like a loyal companion. I know what you’re thinking, ‘She’s such a good friend, why would you even want to hurt her feelings?’. Well it’s hard to explain why I did what I did. But maybe she finally saw what I was trying to do - to drive her away, she left me. Alone. You may think after such elaborate tasks I did to make her leave that I’d be glad she left. I wasn’t (Obviously). Things started to take a dark turn after she left. It’s like she was the light.
        
        
        And all those things that I let happen to her? They started to hit me too but on a different intensity. Karma sure is a boomerang. I could feel myself crumbling. I started losing everything; losing sight of what was important; losing my happiness; losing my talents and finally, losing myself. Out of nowhere, she appeared again. My lost friend. The friend I drove away. It was as if she could sense that I was falling apart. She saw me, the real me. The one who couldn’t even cry for help. The one who was voiceless and now, just weak.


        She started healing me. Without myself realizing it, she started to help me get back on my feet. She made me see that I was enough and that all those people who I deemed to be absolutely vital even though they didn’t, they valued less than a speck of dust. I differentiated those who really loved me for who I am from those who were trying to just change me into someone they preferred. Our perspectives started to grow similar and it was as if I could understand everything more clearly. “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you into something else is the greatest accomplishment” –Ralph Waldo Emerson – She taught me this.
        
        I didn’t even notice I was becoming whole again. I started to read and write, I did a hippity - hop dance whenever I walked (A ridiculous sight if you ask me but it didn’t matter). I could see that for so long I valued other’s happiness more than I valued mine. That in the process of making sure others found themselves, I lost myself. Whatever I did was solely for other’s welfare, not mine and not once did I get gratitude in return. And I took all those shameful comments straight to my heart without recognizing that they mean nothing unless I believe in them. The moment I started believing in myself again, I knew I was stronger than ever.


        And I owe it all to my friend. My long lost friend. The friend that I missed. The friend that I needed. The friend in the mirror.</p>
