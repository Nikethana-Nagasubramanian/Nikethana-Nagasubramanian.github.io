This is my Portfolio. For the name and navbar, instead of conventional way of having navbar at right end or left end, I kept
in the middle. For the about me section, I preferred a column-wise representation with a photo beside it.

About me section showcases my key-points and what I'm interested towards more.

Followed by the Education Section which I have sectioned in <div> to showcase the logo, University details
and my year of graduation. In this I have also included relevant courses I have studied for the recruiters 
to know the knowledge of the person they are hiring easily.

The Work Experience Section showcases a my past experiences in a TimeLine format. This also is a fun way 
of looking back where I've worked and is precise, concise. A short 3 point summary of my roles and responsibilities
helps the recruiter to make a decision quickly.

I believe a person's interests adds a lot more to education and work experience. I have included what I do for my creative
part here : through a photograph display section and a writing display section. The anecdotes navigate to a different page
so as to keep the pages organized. 

And finally the Contact Me space encases the primary social-media links : LinkedIn, Github and Twitter followed by an option
to email me Or Call Me. For privacy purposes, I haven't included any original number.
